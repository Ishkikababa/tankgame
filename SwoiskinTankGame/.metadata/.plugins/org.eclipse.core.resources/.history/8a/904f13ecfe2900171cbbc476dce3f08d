//  all "variables" in an interface are actually static constants (because
//  interfaces cannot be instantiated, so no instances of the "variables"
//  exist to be re-assigned by program code)

// Note, also, that this file is defined as an interface (as opposed to an
//  abstract class) so that the other classes in this program can implement
//  it (as opposed to extending it); this frees up those classes to extend
//  other classes

// Finally, note that even though some of the constants below are used in
//  only one file, having all of the game constants in one place (here)
//  makes them more accessible to anyone viewing or editing the game code
